Kunal's Note: This is a reposting of my group's code. I personally worked along with Zachary Qin on the table.c module which handles the backend of the game.
In addition I also worked on implementing a lot of the pre-made networking code in network.c into our own program i.e. when to send and receive messages from 
different clients.
